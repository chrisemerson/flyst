Flyst
=====

Short for 'Flying List', Flyst is an Android app to help manage duty pilot days on the airfield. It is designed to run on a Nook SimpleTouch e-reader, modified to respond better to touch inputs and running stock Android 2.1.

Flyst is set up as a launcher application so that it can be set to boot at power on, and the android system underneath entirely hidden from view from most users.
